终于有时间去学习下vertical-align 
顺便可以做翻译

# 9.2.2.1 Anonymous inline boxes
Any text that is directly contained inside a block container element (not inside an inline element) must be treated as an anonymous inline element.

In a document with HTML markup like this:


<p>Some <em>emphasized</em> text</p>
the <p> generates a block box, with several inline boxes inside it. The box for "emphasized" is an inline box generated by an inline element (<em>), but the other boxes ("Some" and "text") are inline boxes generated by a block-level element (<p>). The latter are called anonymous inline boxes, because they do not have an associated inline-level element.

vertical-align is used to align inline-level elements. These are elements, whose display property evaluates to

inline,
inline-block or
inline-table (not considered in this article).

大致是说在 块元素里的 文本节点“Some” "text" (但是它又不在行内元素里），所以它被称作匿名行内元素
